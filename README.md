Usually, we upload files from the browser to the server using plain HTML Forms.
Validation of the uploaded file (optionally) happens after complete upload to the server on the server side.
This project is trying to do the validation on the client side using Javascript, before the upload actually happens.
Since javascript on modern browsers are so power packed, validation on the client side avoids uploading 
faulty files to the server, especially when the file is huge.
